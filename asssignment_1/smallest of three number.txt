step1: start 
step2: enter first ,second, third number 
step3: if the first number is smaller than second and third. 
         yes then  print it
step4: else second number is smaller than first and third 
       yes print it 
step5: end 














Check if the first element is smaller than second and third. If yes then print it.

Else if check if the second element is smaller than first and third. If yes then print it.

Else third is the smallest element and print it.

Below is the implementation of the above approach
